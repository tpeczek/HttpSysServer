HttpSysServer with HTTP/2 support
=================================

This repo contains a [fork](https://github.com/aspnet/HttpSysServer) of web server for ASP.NET Core based on the Windows [Http Server API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364510.aspx) extended with HTTP/2 support.

There is a blog post available describing implementation details:
- [HTTP/2 with Server Push proof of concept for ASP.NET Core HttpSysServer](https://www.tpeczek.com/2017/04/http2-with-server-push-proof-of-concept.html)

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tpeczek).
